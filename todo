1. Extract residual stream for one pair of contrastive examples

2. Compute steering vector (option to normalize, intervene on strength, etc)

3. Inject steering vector back into residual stream via a hook function 

4. Further decode responses 

5. Refactor code for 200 examples 

6. Compute eigenvalues as a relative_discriminability_metric 





OK, so the theory in my head makes sense but the norm of the LDA steering vector is 
so large (140000???). Why is that? It is probably due to the fact that it is in the original units 
..when we multiply by the covariance matrix.

One solution is to normalize everything before we find the solution or normalize after. 
Steering vector with fisher criterion and mean difference are VASTLY different (even when normalized).
What does this mean??

Are the eigenvalues a good measure of separability?? or is it just a noisy signal. A few problems is that 
at certain times when I run the code, the first layer has the highest eigenvalue which does not make sense unless
because the initial layer is initialized in such a way that the within variance between class is INCREDIBLY small 
perhaps we could just use between class variance as a meaasure then! Not eigenvalues.
