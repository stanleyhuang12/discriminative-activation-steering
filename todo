1. Extract residual stream for one pair of contrastive examples

2. Compute steering vector (option to normalize, intervene on strength, etc)

3. Inject steering vector back into residual stream via a hook function 

4. Further decode responses 

5. Refactor code for 200 examples 

6. Compute eigenvalues as a relative_discriminability_metric
